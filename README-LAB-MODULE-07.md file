Gateway Device Application (Connected Devices)
 Lab Module 07
Description
 What does your implementation do?
My implementation creates an MQTT client for the Gateway Device Application (GDA) using the Eclipse Paho library. The MqttClientConnector class implements IPubSubClient and MqttCallbackExtended interfaces to provide connection management, message publishing, and topic subscription capabilities. It integrates with DeviceDataManager to enable MQTT communication between the GDA and other IoT devices through a Mosquitto broker.

How does your implementation work?

The MqttClientConnector uses the Paho MQTT library to connect to a Mosquitto broker on localhost:1883. Configuration parameters are loaded from PiotConfig.props including broker address, port, and keep-alive settings. When DeviceDataManager starts, it creates the MQTT client, connects to the broker, and subscribes to four topics: GDA management status, CDA actuator responses, CDA sensor messages, and system performance messages. The client implements callback methods (connectComplete, connectionLost, deliveryComplete, messageArrived) to handle MQTT events. Messages are published using the publishMessage() method with QoS support, and incoming messages trigger the messageArrived() callback for processing.
